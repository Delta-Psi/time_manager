[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,

## TODO
- [ ] Restructure the app in general; split the build step into different methods.
- [ ] Make sure the app doesn't suspend while it's counting down.
- [ ] Present/update the notification by minute instead of by second maybe?
- [ ] Prevent the clock icon completely vanishing in the release apk.
